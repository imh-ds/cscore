#' Compute Weighted Row Means with Missing Data Handling (Internal)
#'
#' Computes a weighted mean for each row of a data frame or matrix, allowing for
#' missing values. Weights are normalized within each row to ensure they sum to
#' 1 over the non-missing entries.
#'
#' @param df A numeric data frame or matrix. May contain \code{NA} values.
#' @param weights A numeric vector of column weights, of the same length as the
#'   number of columns in \code{df}.
#'
#' @return A numeric vector of weighted means, one for each row of \code{df}.
