#' Topological Sort of a Directed Graph (Internal)
#'
#' Internal helper to perform a topological sort on a directed acyclic graph
#' (DAG), represented as a data frame with `from` and `to` columns.
#'
#' @param df A data frame with columns `from` and `to`, each representing
#'   directed edges.
#'
#' @return A character vector with the nodes in topologically sorted order.
