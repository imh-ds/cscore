\title{Keep Higher Order Constructs from Composite List}
\usage{
keep_higher_order_variable(composite_list, higher_order_variables)
}
\arguments{
\item{composite_list}{A required named list of vectors. Each name in the list
represents a composite variable, and the corresponding vector contains the
column names that are associated with the indicators comprising said
composite variable.}

\item{higher_order_variables}{A vector containing the names of higher order
variables.}
}
\value{
The function returns a new list that is a subset of 
\code{composite_list}, including only the vectors whose names are in
\code{higher_order_variables.}
}
\description{
Takes a composite list as input and only keeps the vectors that match higher
order constructs/variables.
}

# Specify the named list with composite names and their respective indicators
composite_list <- composite_list(

  # Lower-order composites
