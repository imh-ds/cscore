\title{Compute Weighted Row Means with Missing Data Handling (Internal)}
\usage{
weighted_row_mean(df, weights)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A numeric data frame or matrix. May contain \code{NA} values.}

\item{weights}{A numeric vector of column weights, of the same length as the
number of columns in \code{df}.}
}
\value{
A numeric vector of weighted means, one for each row of \code{df}.
}
\description{
Computes a weighted mean for each row of a data frame or matrix, allowing for
missing values. Weights are normalized within each row to ensure they sum to
1 over the non-missing entries.
