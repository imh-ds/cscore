\usage{
is_discrete_variable(x, threshold = 10)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A vector to be evaluated for discreteness. Typically numeric or
factor-like.}

\item{threshold}{An integer specifying the maximum number of unique values a
numeric vector can have to still be considered discrete. Defaults to 10.}
}
\value{
Logical scalar indicating whether \code{x} is treated as a discrete
  variable.
}
\description{
Determines whether a vector should be treated as a discrete variable based on
its type and number of unique values. Factors, ordered factors, and integers
are treated as discrete. Numeric vectors are considered discrete if they have
no more than \code{threshold} unique values and all unique values are
integer-like (within floating-point tolerance).
