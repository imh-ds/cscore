\title{Coerce Numeric Vector to Discrete If Integer-Like (Internal)}
\usage{
coerce_to_discrete_if_integer_like(x, threshold = 10)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A vector, typically numeric. Non-numeric vectors are returned as-is.}

\item{threshold}{An integer specifying the maximum number of unique values to
consider the input as discrete. Defaults to 10.}
}
\value{
A vector of the same length as \code{x}, possibly rounded if numeric
  and considered discrete.
}
\description{
If the input is numeric and contains a sufficiently small number of unique
values (less than or equal to \code{threshold}), this function rounds values
to the nearest integer—effectively treating the vector as discrete.
Non-numeric inputs are returned unchanged.
