\title{Build a Composite Structural Model from Link Paths}
\usage{
composite_model(...)
}
\arguments{
\item{...}{One or more `link` path objects created by the `link()` function.
Each must be a data frame with columns `from` and `to`, representing
directed edges in the model.}
}
\value{
A list with three components:
\describe{
  \item{\code{paths}}{A data frame of all combined directed edges.}
  \item{\code{outcomes}}{A character vector of terminal outcome node(s) (i.e., nodes with no outgoing edges).}
  \item{\code{order}}{A character vector of all nodes sorted in topological order, from predictors to outcomes.}
}
}
\description{
Combines one or more sets of `link` paths into a unified structural model.
Each input must be a data frame generated by the `link()` function,
specifying directed associations between variables. The function merges these
links, identifies the outcome variable(s), and computes a valid topological
ordering. The model is assumed to be a directed acyclic graph.
