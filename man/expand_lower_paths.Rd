\title{Expand Paths by Decomposing Composite Lower Paths (Internal)}
\usage{
expand_lower_paths(paths, composite_list)
}
\arguments{
\item{paths}{A data frame with columns `from` and `to`, representing directed
edges.}

\item{composite_list}{A list with an element named `higher`, which is a named
list mapping composite node names to character vectors of their constituent
nodes.}
}
\value{
A data frame with the same structure as `paths`, where composite
  `from` nodes are replaced by one row for each of their component nodes.
}
\description{
Expands a set of directed edges by replacing higher-level composite nodes in
the `from` column with their corresponding lower-level components, as defined
in a `composite_list`.
