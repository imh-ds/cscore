\title{Export Metrics (Reliability & Validity)}
\usage{
export_metrics(metrics, digits, name = NULL, file)
}
\arguments{
\item{metrics}{A required list object. The list should contain an array for
composite scores under \code{data}, a data frame of indicator loadings and
weights under \code{metrics}, and composite validity value under
\code{validity}.}

\item{digits}{The decimal places for the metrics to be rounded to. Default is
3.}

\item{name}{An optional string denoting the study/analysis name.}

\item{file}{A required file path. If specified, the results will be written
as a formatted excel workbook.}
}
\value{
A formatted excel workbook saved to specified file path.
}
\description{
A function to export a \code{metrics} object as a formatted
  excel workbook to the specified \code{file} path. The format is consistent
  with what is typically reported in APA 7th edition, and can be copy and
  pasted directly into a Word document or similar document software.

\details{
Indicator loadings (\eqn{\lambda_i}) are computed as the bivariate
correlation between each indicator \eqn{I_i} and the correlation-weighted
composite score \eqn{\bar{C}_c}:

\deqn{\lambda_i = \mathrm{cor}(I_i, \bar{C}_c)}

Two reliability metrics are reported: Cronbach's alpha (\eqn{\alpha}) and
composite reliability (\eqn{\rho_c}, also referred to as McDonald's omega,
\eqn{\omega}).

Cronbach's alpha is defined as:

\deqn{\alpha = \frac{k \bar{c}}{\bar{v} + (k - 1)\bar{c}}}

where \eqn{k} is the number of indicators, \eqn{\bar{c}} is the average
inter-item covariance, and \eqn{\bar{v}} is the average indicator variance.
Alpha assumes tau-equivalence (equal loadings across indicators) and is
sensitive to the number of indicators. While widely used, it is not
recommended due to these limitations; it is reported here for completeness
only.

Composite reliability (\eqn{\rho_c}) is a weighted reliability estimate based
on user-defined indicator weights. It uses the same formula as McDonald's
omega but allows loadings to be weighted according to the composite score
structure:

\deqn{\rho_c = \frac{\left(\sum \lambda_i w_i\right)^2}{\left(\sum \lambda_i
w_i\right)^2 + \sum e_{w_i}}}

where \eqn{w_i} is the weight for indicator \eqn{i}, and \eqn{e_{w_i}} is the
weighted measurement error:

\deqn{e_{w_i} = (1 - \lambda_i^2) \cdot w_i}

Although this metric is labeled \eqn{\rho_c} to align with PLS-SEM
nomenclature, it is mathematically equivalent to omega and may be reported as
either.

Average Variance Extracted (AVE) measures the proportion of variance captured
by the construct relative to measurement error. It is defined as:

\deqn{\mathrm{AVE} = \frac{\sum \lambda_{w_i}^2}{\sum \lambda_{w_i}^2 + \sum
e_{w_i}}}

where the weighted squared loading is:

\deqn{\lambda_{w_i}^2 = \lambda_i^2 \cdot w_i}

AVE is commonly used in the Fornell-Larcker criterion for discriminant
validity:

\deqn{\sqrt{\mathrm{AVE}_i} > \max_{j} (r_{ij})}

That is, the square root of AVE for a construct should exceed its highest
correlation with any other construct.
