\title{Check Whether a Directed Graph is Acyclic (Internal)}
\usage{
check_dag(paths)
}
\arguments{
\item{paths}{A data frame with columns `from` and `to`, each representing the
edges of a directed graph.}
}
\value{
A logical value: `TRUE` if the graph is acyclic (i.e., a DAG),
  `FALSE` otherwise.
}
\description{
Determines whether a directed graph, represented as a data frame of edges,
forms a directed acyclic graph (DAG). Uses topological traversal to verify
acyclicity.
